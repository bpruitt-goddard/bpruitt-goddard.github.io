* Policy
<div class="presenter-note">1 The current "rule" that should be recorded as policy</div>
<div class="presenter-note">1 eg Only parent holder can modify the holder's data</div>
<div class="presenter-note">1 What does this say about n-level parents?</div>


* Requirement
<div class="presenter-note">3 The more general case</div>
<div class="presenter-note">3 Only authorized holders can view a holder's data.</div>

* Make the distinction for a more robust design
<div class="presenter-note">4 Programming to requirement will mean only metadata (requirement) will have to change</div>
