* Refactoring is like a growth that requires surgery
<div class="presenter-note">1 The longer you wait to excise it, the harder it is going to be to do it</div>
<div class="presenter-note">1 Coding is like gardening more-so than construction - no set plan. Some things grow while others die. You move things around</div>

* When to do it?

&nbsp;&nbsp; * Duplication

&nbsp;&nbsp; * Nonorthogonal design

&nbsp;&nbsp; * Outdated knowledge

&nbsp;&nbsp; * Performance

* Tips
<div class="presenter-note">3 Don't refactor and add functionality at the same time</div>
<div class="presenter-note">3 Take short, deliberate steps to avoid prolonged debugging</div>
