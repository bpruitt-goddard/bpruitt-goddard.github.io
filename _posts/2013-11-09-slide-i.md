* Code Generators

<div style="float: right"><img src="assets/images/all-the-things.png" /></div>

  &nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Passive
<div class="presenter-note">1 Run once to produce result and then divorced from generator. Result is important part. eg new source files with header info, one-off conversions</div>
<div class="presenter-note">1 Doesn't have to be 100% accurate either. Might be easier to fix mistakes after conversion does most of the work</div>

  &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Active
<div class="presenter-note">2 Used each time result is required. Generator is important part.</div>
<div class="presenter-note">2 Used to keep code DRY. Write representation once and convert it to all needed formats</div>


* Not Just Code
<div class="presenter-note">4 Automate approval processes (similar to our code signing)</div>
<div class="presenter-note">4 Anything that doesn't require human input -> that results in errors/misinterpretation of instructions</div>
